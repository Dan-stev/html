                  <td><p>-Lungmen is an autonomous region of Yan, located between Kazdel and Ursus. A prosperous, advanced nomadic city, it is governed by the Yan imperial family member Wei Yenwu and acts as a "special economic zone" with greater autonomy such as a largely independent government and economy, making it more progressive and open to foreign influences than Yan. Lungmen's prosperity and economic prowess is shown by their currency, Lungmen dollar (LMD), which is widely used in international transactions across Terra. In adition, Lungmen is also the youngest county within Yan —under the administrative code 0019.

                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lungmen's urban planning is based surrounding the Central Business District (CBD) located on the city's downtown area, above the artificial river that spans across the city. A series of expressways encircling the downtown area connect various nodes within Lungmen. On the other hand, Lungmen's treatment towards the Infected is known to be harsh, though not to the same degree as the neighboring Ursus; Indeed, the majority of the Infected Lungmenites were confined into slums where they live in lower standards than the rest of the Lungmenites. That was until Reunion's invasion.</td>

                    Most of the time, P.L. is known as a delivery company made up of Messengers who will deliver the package to its destination "no matter what it takes." However, P.L. also allegedly provides many other services, from armed deliveries to escort missions. P.L. owns many commercial venues (one of which includes a bar named "The Ends of the Earth") and safehouses around Lungmen.</td>
